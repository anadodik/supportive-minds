							Student-athletes are at a higher risk than their non-athlete peers for certain mental health challenges, including substance use, eating disorders, depression, and social or performance anxiety. Supportive Minds can help by collaborating with counseling centers and athletic departments to create a campus environment that prioritizes mental wellbeing. This includes efforts to destigmatize mental illness within athletic programs and developing processes for identifying and referring students who require clinical support as well as by providing direct mental health services to student-athletes through targeted workshops and individualized care. We are dedicated to supporting the mental well-being of student-athletes and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive both on and off the field.

							<p>
								I am passionate about working with individuals from all walks of life, with a particular focus on supporting teens and young adults who identify on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, as well as anyone feeling uncertain about their identity and purpose regardless of age, sexuality, and gender.
								<br/><br/>
								My practice is rooted in a relational, community-oriented approach, where I believe that connection and understanding are key drivers of healing and recovery. I bring experience in addressing a broad range of mental health concerns, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, mood disorders, and addiction/addictive processes.
								<br/><br/>
								I integrate an interpersonal and relational framework, focusing on identity, context, and values to meet the unique needs of each client. I do not subscribe to a one-size-fits-all model of healing; rather, I believe that each personâ€™s journey is distinct. My work emphasizes Harm Reduction, Mentalization-Based Therapy, CBT, and Motivational Interviewing
								<br/><br/>
								In my free time I enjoy heavy music, boxing, oddities, and being outdoors with my dogs.

								My approach to therapy is client centered, collaborative, empowerment oriented, and evidence based.  I am intentional about providing space for curiosity and not judgement. I am a harm reduction-oriented therapist who has been trained in Integrated Harm Reduction Psychotherapy, Motivational Interviewing, Mentalization Based Therapy, Community Reinforcement and Family Training and various other contextual and person-centered based modalities. 
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>	
								My life's work is about curating a safe and welcoming environment for marginalized people; people who have been marginalized by the stigma of mental illness, addictions, various behaviors deemed as high-risk, race, sex and different political realities. I am committed to using the field of mental health and psychology to uplift social justice causes and actions to promote liberation for my clients. I have worked with people who use substances and who suffer from various different comorbidities including medical and psychiatric most of my career. Most importantly, I am here to help my clients feel seen and empowered to move to a place of self-efficacy.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>
								When I am not working as a psychotherapist and business owner I enjoy physical activities like running, hiking and strength training. I love watching sports, experiencing art and listening to music, especially live music. I am lucky enough to share my life with my wife and our children.
